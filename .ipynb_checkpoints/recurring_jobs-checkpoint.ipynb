      "# Use Cases: Nightly Redeployment\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm the owner of an ecommerce website and would like to use \u0177hat to implement an item recommender. To help with this, I've allowed users to \"star\" items they're interested in on my website, allowing me to track and compare users' preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each time a user stars an item, those results are stored on database (for this example we'll say MySQL), a process which might look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"files/user_star_table.png\" width=600>\n",
      "\n",
      "While it may be easy to build and deploy a recommender once, a static recommender model often becomes outdated quickly. Consequently,  I'd like my recommender to be updated as new items are added to the shop and users produce more data. To achieve this, my recommender model must be retrained periodically and then redeployed to keep the recommendations current."
