      "# Use Cases: Nightly Redeployment\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm the owner of an ecommerce website and would like to use \u0177hat to implement an item recommender. To help with this, I've allowed users to \"star\" items they enjoy on my website, allowing me to track and compare users' preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time a user stars an item, those results are stored to a database (for this example we'll say MySQL), a process which might look something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"files/user_star_table.png\" width=600>\n",
      "\n",
      "Though it may be easy to build and deploy a recommender once, in this case that may not be enough. As new items are added to the shop, and users produce more data, I'd like my recommender to be able to take advantage of the new information. What I would like is for my model to be retrained periodically on my growing dataset and then deploy to serve my website."
